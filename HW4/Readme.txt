int main() : Program starting point.

class Node : This class is used to store the edge's vertex and weight.

void prim(int graph[26][26],int startpoint) : Input the undirected graph and the start point,then we can get the result of Prim's Algorithm.

class shortestPath : This class is used to store the point we want to visit and the distance from the start point to the point.

void dijkstra(int graph[26][26],int startpoint) : Input the directed gragh and the start point,then we can get the result of Dijkstra's Algorithm.
